# Module 2 Challenge
In this challenge i was tasked with creating a personal website for myself. During this project I used CSS to create a Grid for my project links and screenshots. Unfotunately at this point in the class, I have only finished one project, which is this one. To remedy this I chose to make place holder "websites" and gave them stock photos and placeholder names. I have linked them to my GitHub.
